**Dice Game Web App**

This repository contains a simple web application that simulates a dice game. The game involves two players who each roll a dice, and the player with the higher dice value wins. In case of a tie, the game is declared a draw.

**Features:**

- Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a dynamic and interactive experience.
- Randomly generates dice images for both players using JavaScript's `Math.random()` function.
- Compares the generated dice values to determine the winner or declare a draw.
- Displays the outcome with a message at the top of the page.

**How to Play:**

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Refresh" button to start a new round of the dice game.
3. Observe the dice images for both Player 1 and Player 2.
4. The game result, either "Player1 wins," "Player2 wins," or "DRAW," will be displayed as a heading on the page.

**Note:**

- The paths to dice images and stylesheets are set to local paths. Adjust these paths if you intend to deploy the app online.
- This project is for educational and demonstration purposes and can be extended with additional features and improvements.

Feel free to fork and modify this project, and have fun playing the virtual dice game!
